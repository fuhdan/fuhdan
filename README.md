    lifeGoal: "To write code that works AND is secure on the first try"
};
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Are you available for hire?
**A:** Like a taxi in the rain - always available but might take a while to arrive. Send me a message!

### Q: What's your coding superpower?
**A:** I can create bugs faster than any debugger can find them. It's a gift, really.

### Q: Do you work with [insert technology here]?
**A:** If it involves network security, automation, or doesn't require me to understand modern CSS frameworks, probably yes!

### Q: How do you stay motivated?
**A:** Imposter syndrome and caffeine - a deadly combination that somehow works.

### Q: What's your development environment?
**A:** Chaos, mostly. But organized chaos with VS Code and a lot of terminal windows.

### Q: Can you fix my printer?
**A:** I'm a developer, not a magician. Though sometimes the difference is unclear.

### Q: What's your favorite programming language?
**A:** Python, because it's like network automation magic. Plus, it doesn't make me want to throw my laptop out the window like PHP sometimes does.

### Q: Do you prefer tabs or spaces?
**A:** I prefer peace, so let's use Prettier and never speak of this again.

<summary>🎁 Surprise! Click me for a random programming joke</summary>

**Why do programmers prefer dark mode?**

Because light attracts bugs! 🐛

**Bonus joke:** A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join you?"
